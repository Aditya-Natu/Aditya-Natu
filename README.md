# Aditya Natu's GitHub Profile

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you shall find some of my past coding project with user documentation. The codes available right now are:

## 1. 2-D Elliptic PDE Solver for Computational Fluid Dynamics
CFD codes that automatically discretises and solves equations with time-evolution, diffusion, advection, and source terms on rectangular domains. The code uses the Finite Volume Method and needs rectangular cells. You can define your own grid or use my function to develop a compound-interest grid. All parameters (like the diffusion coefficient, advection velocity, etc.) can be different for each cell. The boundary conditions need not be uniform over the walls, and you can use mixed boundary conditions. Find the code here: [https://github.com/Aditya-Natu/FVM-Solver](https://github.com/Aditya-Natu/FVM-Solver). Make sure you read User_Manual.pdf!

## 2. Streamline, Streakline and Pathline Visualisation Tool for 2D flows
Codes for generating Streamlines, Streaklines, and Pathlines for 2D flows when you have an expression for the velocity profile. Find the code here: [https://github.com/Aditya-Natu/2D-Stream-Streak-Path-liner](https://github.com/Aditya-Natu/2D-Stream-Streak-Path-liner). Make sure you read User_Manual.pdf!

## 3. Rack-and-Pinion Steering Design Script
A script that will calculate the lengths of the steering arm, the tie rods, and the distance between the rack and the axle for a rack-and pinion steering system. It will also show you with a plot how much does the designed mechanism deviate from the ideal steering condition. Find the code here: [https://github.com/Aditya-Natu/Rack-and-Pinion-Steering-Geometry-Calculator](https://github.com/Aditya-Natu/Rack-and-Pinion-Steering-Geometry-Calculator). Make sure you read User_Manual.pdf! (Note: I worked on this project along with my friend and teammate Ankit Sharma. It couldn't be possible without his contribution and I am very greatful to him.)
